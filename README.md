# Yii2 OTP Utils

This is a simple Yii2 extension I wrote mainly as an exercise to learn Yii2.

It's a simple glue module to manage TOTP/HOTP secrets and scratch codes (backup codes) in a YII 2 extension providing it's own tables and related models. It has a simple and straightforward API.

## Installation

php composer.phar require "mad/yii2-otputil"
